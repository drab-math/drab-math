- 👋 Hi, I’m @drab-math
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, containerization, sci-fi & fantasy books, and being as good of a father as I can be.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Powershell scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are beginner friendly or in Linux automation.
- 📫 How to reach me a message on Github is nice =)
